This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# 🎮 Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe (a.k.a. Noughts and Crosses) game built with two difficulty modes: **Normal** and **Unbeatable**. In the **Unbeatable** mode, the game uses the **Minimax algorithm**, ensuring the AI never loses!

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Two Game Modes:
  - **Normal Mode**: Play against a simple AI with random moves.
  - **Unbeatable Mode**: Play against an intelligent AI that uses the Minimax algorithm.
- 🎯 Always results in a win, loss, or draw — no bugs or endless loops.
- 🧠 Minimax ensures optimal gameplay from the AI.
- 📱 Responsive and interactive UI (customize depending on your tech stack).

## 🧠 What is the Minimax Algorithm?

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in two-player turn-based games like Tic-Tac-Toe. It simulates all possible moves to choose the best one, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

In **Unbeatable Mode**, the AI:
- Maximizes its chances of winning.
- Minimizes the player's chances of winning.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/unbeatable-tic-tac-toe.git
cd unbeatable-tic-tac-toe


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
